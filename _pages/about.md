Welcome to my personal website!ðŸ‘‹ My name is Kirill, and I am currently pursuing an MSc in Computer Vision at <a href='https://mbzuai.ac.ae/'>MBZUAI</a>, where I work in the <a href='https://mbzuai.ac.ae/research/research-center/ciai/'>Center of Integrative Intelligence</a> (CIAI) led by <a href='https://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/kunz1/index.html'>Prof. Kun Zhang</a> and <a href='https://mbzuai.ac.ae/study/faculty/professor-eric-xing'>Prof. Eric Xing</a>. My research interests primarily focus on self-supervised learning and knowledge distillation in the computer vision domain on which I work under the guidance of my supervisor <a href='https://zhiqiangshen.com'>Dr. Zhiqiang Shen</a>.

Aside from my academic pursuits, I sometimes participate in different machine competitions and achieved the rank of Competition Expert on Kaggle. Recently my team took 3rd and 4th place at the <a href='https://sensorium2022.net/'>Sensorium</a> competition at NeurIPS. 

Prior to joining to MBZUAI, I obtained my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Mathematics from St. Petersburg Polytechnic University and worked at <a href='https://soteranalytics.com/'>Soter Analytics</a> as Machine Learning Engineer where I helped to develop ergonomic solutions and wearable devices.
